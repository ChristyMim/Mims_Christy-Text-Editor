So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself - nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert 
retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is 
essential to victory. - Franklin D. Roosevelt

I would rather belong to a poor nation that was free than to a rich nation that had ceased to be in love with liberty.- Woodrow Wilson

I hope we once again have reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited. There's a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics: 
As government expands, liberty contracts. - Ronald Reagan

When one side only of a story is heard and often repeated, the human mind becomes impressed with it insensibly. - George Washington

If national pride is ever justifiable or excusable it is when it springs, not from power or riches, grandeur or glory, but from conviction of national innocence, information, and 
benevolence. - John Adams

Think about every problem, every challenge, we face. The solution to each starts with education. - George H.W. Bush

Mankind must put an end to war - or war will put an end to mankind. - John F. Kennedy

I favor the policy of economy, not because I wish to save money, but because I wish to save people. The men and women of this country who toil are the ones who bear the cost of the 
government. Every dollar that we carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meager. Every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so much the 
more abundant. Economy is idealism in its most practical form. - Calvin Coolidge

To waste, to destroy, our natural resources, to skin and exhaust the land instead of using it so as to increase its usefulness, will result in undermining in the days of our children
the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to them amplified and developed. - Theodore Roosevelt

Officeholders are the agents of the people, not their masters. Not only is their time and labor due to the government, but they should scrupulously avoid in their political action,
as well as in the discharge of their official duty, offending by a display of obtrusive partisanship their neighbors who have relations with them as public officials. - Grover Cleveland

In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. From time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex
to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for,by, and of the people. Well, if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who
among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden. - Ronald Reagan
